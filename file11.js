// Basic Theory 
// AJAX :Asynchronous javascript and XML

// is a set of "web development technique
// using many web technologies on the "client - side"
// to create asynchronous web application 

// with Ajax , web applications can send and retrive 
// data from server asynchronouslly (in the background)
// without interfaring with the display and 
// behaviour of the existing page 

// we don't use data in XML format anymore 
//  we use JSON now

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server 
// 1) xmlHTTPRequest (old ways of doing)
// 2) fetch API (new ways of doing )
// 3) axios (this is 3rd party library)
